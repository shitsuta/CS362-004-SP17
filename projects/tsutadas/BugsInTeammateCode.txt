Tested Card: smithy
Result: Bug Found
Detail: smithy does not draw the correct number of cards. 
This is due to modification in for loop. 
It is supposed to draw three cards but for loop is set as for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++) that let player draw four cards. 
It should be for (i = 0; i < 3; i++).
I found it with gdb executed codes line by line. I occasionally checked variables so to see if there is anything wrong.


Tested Card: adventurer
Result: Bug Found
Detail: adventurer draws incorrect number of treasure cards. It let player draw three three treasure cards instead of two. 
This is caused by modification in while loop. In newAdventurer, made by my teammate, while loop is set to while (drawntreasure<=2). This should be while (drawntreasure<2) as in original version of dominion.
I found it with gdb executed codes line by line. I occasionally checked variables so to see if there is anything wrong.

Tested Card: council_room
Result: Bug Found
Detail: concil_room does not draw correct amount of cards for player who played the card. 
This is caused by modification inside for loop. In original version, it has if (i != currentPlayer) around drawCard that is used to stop currentPlayer draws one more card. 
I found it with gdb executed codes line by line. I occasionally checked variables so to see if there is anything wrong.
 

Tested Card: village
